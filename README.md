# Uni.GUI

## Texture API

`UiApp` owns external Dear ImGui textures.

- Create a texture with `UiApp::TextureCreate()`.
- Destroy it with `UiApp::TextureDestroy()` or `UiTexture::Destroy()`.
- Use `UiTexture` as a lightweight handle/view for CPU pixel writes (`Pixels()`, `PixelsAt()`, `Clear()`, `MarkFullUpdate()`, `MarkUpdateRect()`).
- Retrieve the opaque handle with `UiTexture::Handle()` or `UiApp::TextureGetHandle()`.

### Design notes

- Texture registration now goes through Dear ImGui's user texture API instead of a global snapshot registry.
- GPU destruction is deferred until the backend acknowledges `ImTextureStatus_WantDestroy`, so resizing and destruction remain safe across frames.
- Upload helpers preserve `WantCreate` vs `WantUpdates`, which keeps first-frame texture uploads correct.
- No global texture mutexes are used; the lifecycle is owned by the active `UiApp` instance.
